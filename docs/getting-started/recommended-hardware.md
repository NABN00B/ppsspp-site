# Recommended hardware for PPSSPP

## Devices to play on

### Android devices

Nearly any recent phone will work just fine.

NVIDIA Shield TV is probably still the best Android TV machine (yes, in 2024).

### PC

Nearly any PC made the last 15 years will have little to no issue running PPSSPP. It can be a good idea to upgrade your graphics drivers, if possible.

### Mac

Any M1 or later Mac will run it fine. It also works on many Intel Macs but has issues on Radeon GPUs on Mac, unfortunately.

## Controllers

PPSSPP is compatible with almost any game controller. This page lists some things that have been tested to work.

### Controllers for Android

- Basically any Bluetooth controllers, including iPega, Xbox One/X/S and PlayStation 4/5 controllers
- Moga controllers work.

## Controllers for Windows

- Any controller that is usable on Windows will work, those that support XInput will autoconfigure, too.
- Xbox 360 controller with USB adapter
