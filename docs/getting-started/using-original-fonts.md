# Using original PSP fonts

Some games don't supply their own fonts, but instead make use of the fonts built-in to the PSP firmware. PPSSPP ships with some free replacement fonts, but a few games will look better if you use the original fonts instead.

If you have dumped the PSP firmware yourself from a real PSP, you can place the files in this location in your memstick directory:

`/PSP/flash0/font`

These are the files that should be placed there:

- jpn0.pgf
- kr0.pgf
- ltn0.pgf
- ltn1.pgf
- ltn2.pgf
- ltn3.pgf
- ltn4.pgf
- ltn5.pgf
- ltn6.pgf
- ltn7.pgf
- ltn8.pgf
- ltn9.pgf
- ltn10.pgf
- ltn11.pgf
- ltn12.pgf
- ltn13.pgf
- ltn14.pgf
- ltn15.pgf

On the Windows build, you can also replace the fonts directly in the assets subdirectory, but the above will also work.
