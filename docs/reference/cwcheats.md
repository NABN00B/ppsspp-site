# CwCheats

CwCheats is a cheat format originally created for real hacked PSPs, not emulators, inspired by classic
Action Replay codes. As such, it's very low-level and simple.

To use them, you have to download a cheat database and load it in cheat settings, which you can access
from the pause menu in-game if this setting is enabled.

Unfortunately, these cheats are often a bit unstable - if a game starts crashing when you're using them,
try a different cheat.
