# Infrastructure Mode

## Custom servers

"Infrastructure" is what regular multiplayer servers are called, in [PSP parlance](https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/settings/infra.html).

Most of the official servers have long since been shut down, but people have been creating their own replacements. If you know of other ones not listed, e-mail hrydgard+ppsspp@gmail.com, and put "Infrastructure" somewhere in the subject line.

From PPSSPP version 1.19, a number of these will be supported on all networking-enabled platforms, allowing easy online play.

DNS is now auto-configured per game, but we still list the DNS addresses below in case you want to set it manually.

Make sure to choose a unique username in Network settings, as it's hard to prevent name-jacking.

### PS Rewired

[PS Rewired](https://psrewired.com/) is, in their own words, "A revival group that provides emulated online servers for the PS2, PSP and PS3.".

DNS: 67.222.156.250.

This IP will also redirect to other servers for some games, such as the below AG Racing Foundation.

### The AG Racing Foundation

The [Antigravity Racing Foundation](https://agracingfoundation.org/)!

DNS: 147.135.213.57

A project to keep Wipeout Pulse, Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD multiplayer alive by the use of custom infrastructure servers. Made for real PSPs/PS3s, but works with some custom versions of PPSSPP.

Motorstorm: Artic Edge also works on this server.

## MOHH Revival

The [MOHH Revival project](https://mohh-revival.pages.dev/)

DNS: 81.49.107.142

A project replicating `Medal of Honor: Heroes` servers.

### Others

More documentation will be added later here, in the meantime here's a list of projects:

* [Openspy](https://openspy.net/)
* [PSORG](https://github.com/PSOnlineReturnalGaming)
* LittleBigRefresh
* PS3 Reborn (Discord group)
* Outrun2006 Tweaks

## Game compatibility list

### Wipeout Pulse

Infrastructure mode works great in this game, except that for some reason, opponent ship textures are wrong or corrupted. This is not a rendering issue, we are not sure why this happens.

### Driver '76

Might work on Windows.
