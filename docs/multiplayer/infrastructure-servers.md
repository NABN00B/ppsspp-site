# Infrastructure Mode

## Custom server projects

"Infrastructure" is what regular multiplayer servers are called, in [PSP parlance](https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/settings/infra.html).

Most or all of these have long since been shut down, but people have been creating their own replacements. If you know of other ones not listed, e-mail hrydgard+ppsspp@gmail.com, and put "Infrastructure" somewhere in the subject line.

### The AG Racing Foundation

The [Antigravity Racing Foundation](https://agracingfoundation.org/)!

A project to keep Wipeout Pulse, Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD multiplayer alive by the use of custom infrastructure servers. Made for real PSPs/PS3s, but works with some custom versions of PPSSPP. In the future, we can hopefully support this in official builds.
