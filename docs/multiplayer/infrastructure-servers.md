# Infrastructure Mode

## Custom servers

"Infrastructure" is what regular multiplayer servers are called, in [PSP parlance](https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/settings/infra.html).

Most of the official servers have long since been shut down, but people have been creating their own replacements. If you know of other ones not listed, e-mail hrydgard+ppsspp@gmail.com, and put "Infrastructure" somewhere in the subject line.

From PPSSPP version 1.19, a number of these will be supported on all networking-enabled platforms, allowing easy online play.

Make sure to choose a unique username in Network settings, as it's hard to prevent name-jacking.

### PS Rewired

[PS Rewired](https://psrewired.com/) is, in their own words, "A revival group that provides emulated online servers for the PS2, PSP and PS3.".

Their DNS is 67.222.156.250.

This IP will also redirect to other servers for some games, such as the below AG Racing Foundation.

### The AG Racing Foundation

The [Antigravity Racing Foundation](https://agracingfoundation.org/)!

A project to keep Wipeout Pulse, Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD multiplayer alive by the use of custom infrastructure servers. Made for real PSPs/PS3s, but works with some custom versions of PPSSPP.

Motorstorm: Artic Edge also works.
