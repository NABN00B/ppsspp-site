## Ad-Hoc tips

### Port offsets

Some games use network ports that are not allowed for general use on general Linux systems (like Android), where ports 1-1024 are considered `privileged`.

To get around this, PPSSPP supports adding an offset to all network port numbers. Note, this of course means that for two
players to be able to play each other, they must all agree on and use the same port offset. Setting this up can be
tricky to coordinate if you don't have a shared chat, or something.
