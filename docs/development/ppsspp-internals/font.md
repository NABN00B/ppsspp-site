# sceFont

Similar to the various upper level media decoders, sceFont is a user library that we can just load and run.

There seem to be several different versions though, some that require functionality that we don't have yet, so that'll need to be solved somehow.

Some Chinese translations use custom versions of sceFont, see issue #19111. Loading these can fix them in PPSSPP.

## sceReg

sceFont loads font configurations from the PSP system registry using sceReg.
