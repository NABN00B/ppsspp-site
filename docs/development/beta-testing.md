# Beta Testing

## Android beta testing

The beta testing program for PPSSPP for Android is now open!

A few weeks before each new official release, a beta release will be rolled out to participating people, containing most of the new features that will be in the next release. Additionally, there'll be a build every couple of months between major releases.

We only have a beta testing program for Android since Google Play provides convenient tools to automatically roll out new builds to participants. We don't have anything like that yet on the other platforms. On PC, if you want to help testing stuff before release, download the latest development build from the [buildbot](/devbuilds) and report results.

## Beta Testing on iOS through TestFlight

The beta testing program for iOS is now open as well (although only for the free version currently)!

## Important information

Beta builds can have bugs and instabilities, but will usually be usable. If you see unexpected behavior or odd crashes, please report them, as explained below.

If you make a save state in a beta build, it will not load if you go back to the previous "normal" build, but it will load in future versions. Regular in-game save games are portable back and forth, assuming you keep the files around.

On Android 11 or higher, make sure you are using a manually-selected folder for memstick data. [More information](/docs/getting-started/save-data-and-storage).

If you have installed PPSSPP through an APK previously, for example from the buildbot, you will have to uninstall, and install again from Google Play, in order to get your automatic beta updates.
