When exporting the images in draw.io, the resulting files' size will be ~30% larger compared to MS Paint.
I assume this is because of all the anti-aliasing the canvas does.
It can't easily be reduced with GIMP either.

Here's how to circumvent this:
1. Set a solid background color, disable grid and set zoom level to 100%.
2. Print screen around the drawing and paste it into MS Paint. (Yes, really.)
3. Zoom in 400% or more, press Ctrl+A to select the image, and carefully move the drawing into the top left corner.
4. Carefully crop the right and bottom borders of the canvas.
5. Fix up any remaining issues (e.g. missing background on the border) and save as PNG.
