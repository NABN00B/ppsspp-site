## PPSSPP 1.18 - announcement and progress report

PPSSPP 1.18 is now out! Get it on the [download page](/download)! If you're on Android and already have it installed from Google Play, your update will arrive within a week ([to catch crashes early](/docs/reference/android-slow-release)). For the first time for a new official release, iOS will also receive the update on the App Store, however, the Apple Store review process has been problematic recently, so it may take quite a while, unfortunately.

For details on the changes, see the [news item](/news/release-1.18).

## Important fixes in 1.18

* iOS support is now official and has been greatly improved, compared to old side-loaded builds. It's now nearly feature complete, only missing camera emulation and a few minor UX things like easily setting a background image in the menu.
* A lot of potential crashes have been fixed
* As usual, a number of rendering problems have been fixed

For a more detailed changelog, see the [release notes](/news/release-1.18).
