PPSSPP 1.19 is now out! Some of the most important changes are listed below.

Read the [progress report and release announcement](/blog/1-19-release-announcement) for a more high-level summary of the changes!

NOTE! As usual, the Android version on Google Play will roll out slowly over multiple days in order to catch any bad crashes early, so you may have to wait a few days before you receive the update.

Additionally, the iOS version may take even longer due to the unpredictability of the App Store review process.

IMPORTANT: There's been a last minute report of problems with certain PBP files. This will be fixed in a followup release in about a week or so.
