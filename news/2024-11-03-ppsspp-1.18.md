PPSSPP 1.18 is now ready! The most important changes are listed below.

For a more high-level summary of the changes, see the [progress report and release announcement](/blog/1-18-release-announcement)!

NOTE! As usual, the Android version on Google Play will as usual roll out slowly over multiple days in order to catch any bad crashes early, so you may have to wait a few days before you receive the update.

Additionally, the iOS version may take even longer due to the unpredictability of App Store review.

[Download now!](/download)!
