Yup, PPSSPP Gold for iOS is still stuck in review, so I am completely unable to update it.

The free version, however, is up to date.

Here's a [summary of the situation](/blog/stuck-in-app-store-review/), along with the rejection letters, my replies and App Store Review's responses.

I recommend all iOS users to use the free version of PPSSPP until this can be resolved, even if you paid for Gold to support the project!
