## Changes in 1.19.3

1.19 was a big change, as described in [the release announcement](/news/ppsspp-1.19). Atrac3+ music playback, which is a fundamental feature in a lot of games, got a big improvement, leading to many compatibility fixes.

Whenever you make a big change though, it's inevitable that something obscure breaks - in this case, Atrac3 (not +) files generated by other apps than the one used in games failed to decode, due to a broken first packet. This packed should be skipped, but our calculations for that weren't quite right, and neither were the old ones, but they were wrong differently! So previously, it had actually just worked by accident.

This affected a number of game modifications that many people like to play, such as a Crazy Taxi mod that adds back the proper music from the Dreamcast original, and also a number of modified football (soccer) games which lost their music and commentary.

Anyway, now that's fixed and tested on hardware for correctness, and likewise a bunch of other bugs that slipped through previous testing have also been taken care of. For details see the new section in the 1.19 release announcement, linked above!
