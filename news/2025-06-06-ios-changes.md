PPSSPP 1.19 for iOS has been approved, and will be rolling out to devices over the coming week.

After having [massive problems](/blog/stuck-in-app-store-review) getting updates to the iOS Gold version approved, I decided to give up on having a separate app. On iOS (but not other platforms), PPSSPP now is a single app, and you can upgrade to Gold, to support the project, through a simple in-app purchase instead. [Why gold?](/docs/reference/whygold).

The separate PPSSPP Gold app has now been retired. I'm looking into ways to transfer users to the in-app purchase in the PPSSPP app, but I haven't yet managed to find a viable way to do it, without being able to update the existing Gold app. I'm sorry about that! If you know a way to do this (or have contacts in Apple that can help), let me know at hrydgard+ppssppgold@gmail.com.
