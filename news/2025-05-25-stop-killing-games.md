The PPSSPP project's long-term mission is to preserve the treasure of PSP video games for future generations to enjoy.

Fortunately, with the exception of some multiplayer titles and some yet-unsolved glitches, this has been largely achieved for PSP games. However, on newer platforms, it's a different story.

Stop Killing Games is a petition that warns about how digital distribution and DRM now makes it possible and even common for games to be released, played, and then disappear forever with no way to play it in the future. On modern games platforms it's possible for publishers to retroactively unpublish games.

The petition argues for a stop to this practice, and to require game publishers to keep games playable, through whatever means are necessary, when they are "retired" from the market.

Obviously, we agree with this!
