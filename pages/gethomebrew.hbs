    <h1>Demos and homebrew for PPSSPP</h1>

    <h2>PSP Demos</h2>
    <p>Many game companies released downloadable demo versions of their games for the PSP.
        Some of these can run in PPSSPP. These files are legally free to download.
        Unfortunately the PSP Demo Center that used to host them is no longer online.</p>

    <p>There's a new site though that has quite a few:
        <a href="https://playdreamcreate.com/">PlayDreamCreate.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>PSP Homebrew</h2>
    <p>The PSP was released in 2005, and contained a number of bugs that made it easy to run
        your own code on the device. A large community of hackers emerged who wrote their own software
        for the device. There's now a lot of little homemade games to run.</p>

    <h3>Where can I find them?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PPSSPP has a built-in homebrew store which hosts a selection of them.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://archive.org/details/psp-homebrew-library">Homebrew library at Archive.org</a>
        </li>
        <li>Many other sites, use Google.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I get them on my device?</h3>
    <p>If you have manually downloaded homebrew, unzip it and put the game folder in <code>PSP/GAME</code>
        in your memstick directory.
