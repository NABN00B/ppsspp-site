        <p>Since you already have PPSSPP Gold for Windows and macOS, you are eligible to request one Google Play promo
            code, which can be redeemed for PPSSPP Gold for Android free on any Google Play account.</p>

        <p>IMPORTANT! Only request one if you are going to use it!</p>

        <p>Note: If you have requested a code before, you'll get the same one again, which might thus already be spent.
